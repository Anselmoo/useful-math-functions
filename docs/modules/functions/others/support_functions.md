## Support Functions

!!! Info

    Please note that the following functions in the module are not meant to be used
    directly, as they are used by other functions within the module. The goal of
    `useful-math-functions` is to minimize the use of third-party dependencies in its functions.
    However, certain functions are utilized by multiple other functions, and are
    therefore implemented in the `support_functions` module to avoid duplicating code.
    Additionally, some functions still require the `scipy` package in order to be fully
    executed.
